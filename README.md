Introduce
Conclusion prototype for Smart Wardrobe Saver (SWSaver) from studies of personal experiences through different steps starting with an accumulation of problems encountered, planning, modeling, surveying, and finally, prototyping the device. The planning is made with Microsoft Office Visio 2019, Diagram of Unified Modeling Language on https://lucidchart.com, and Model-Based Design with Siemens PLM Community Solid Edge, using Arduino Tool kit for prototype the microcontroller to control Automation devices.
